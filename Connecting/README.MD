This folder is for transmiting data from ESP8266 to HiveMQ
# Connecting to HiveMQ Securely (with certificates)
## Components used to connect the microcontroller, ESP8266 Arduino to HiveMQ 
1. NodeMCU (an ESP8266 board)
2. HiveMQ - a MQTT cloud broker, which can be used for free

## Hardware 
1. NodeMCU 

## Software
1. Arduino IDE installed on the computer
2. HiveMQ MQTT cloud broker platform, which can be used for free. It is a MQTT broker where we can create an account and connect your IOT devices.
